# epmodel Agent Notes

These notes are specific to work under `src/epmodel/`.

## Read First

When working on epmodel parity or topology behavior, read these first:

- `src/epmodel/README.md`
- `doc/idd-schema-alignment/os_hvac_concepts.md`

Also keep these references available when needed:

- `doc/idd-schema-alignment/InputOutputReference.pdf` for EnergyPlus field
  semantics
- `resources/energyplus/` for authoritative EnergyPlus schema shape, field
  order, extensibles, and object-list relationships

Status, queue order, and next-task planning belong in campaign state or
dedicated campaign notes, not in README documents.

## Working Style Preferences

Apply these preferences unless the user asks otherwise.

- Preserve public `openstudio::model` API shape for parity work. Do not add
  new public APIs unless divergence is intentional and explicitly documented.
- For EnergyPlus-only connective-tissue types with no canonical
  `openstudio::model` counterpart, keep public wrapper APIs minimal and keep
  mutators in `*_Impl`.
- For EnergyPlus-only types that exist as real persisted E+ objects but still
  have no canonical same-name `openstudio::model` wrapper, prefer read-only
  public wrappers for now. Let owning parent types and impl code perform
  mutation through `*_Impl` instead of growing standalone public mutator
  surfaces prematurely.
- Prefer the `AirLoopHVAC` style of implementation: keep topology traversal,
  lookup, and canonicalization logic local and readable in the main method
  body.
- Avoid anonymous namespace helper functions, anonymous lambdas used as
  mini-methods, and tiny private helper methods that only hide straightforward
  logic. Inline the code unless a helper clearly improves readability.
- Reduce layers and duplicate naming. Do not introduce separate impl-only
  names for the same conceptual object when the public name already works.
- Keep public wrapper classes thin. For parity-oriented types, put
  substantive behavior, relationship mutation, and helper logic in `*_Impl`.
- In public wrapper headers, group accessors by field or concept. Prefer
  getter / setter / reset blocks for one field at a time over separate
  "all getters" and "all setters" sections.
- If adding a new aligned parent type, add the corresponding `*_Impl` layer
  too. Do not concentrate new behavior in the public base class.
- Prefer high-level typed APIs over raw workspace field access when both
  express the same behavior clearly.
- Prefer composition of existing typed APIs over direct field-level methods.
  Use low-level field access only when no equivalent typed composition exists.
- Prefer pointer/object-target linkage APIs over direct name-string writes for
  object relationships. Reserve `setString(...)` for true scalar data.
- For extensible object-list rows, cast to `WorkspaceExtensibleGroup` and use
  `getTarget(...)` / `setPointer(...)` instead of hand-rolled type-and-name
  lookup. If that path does not work, first suspect missing or incorrect
  object-list/reference markup in the IDD schema rather than falling back to
  name lookup silently.
- For `NodeType` fields, use the shared `ModelObject_Impl` node resolver
  helpers instead of local "read the string and look up the node by name"
  logic. If a getter returns a `Node`, it should be a live linked node, not
  an untracked transient object.
- Do not reach into raw extensible-group mechanics from unrelated code. If a
  caller needs structured extensible mutation, add a private impl-level API on
  the owning type and keep storage manipulation there.
- Add short intent comments where code depends on topology assumptions,
  canonicalization contracts, or parity-driven invariants.
- Prefer object-level identity comparisons over raw handle comparisons when
  the wrappers already express the relationship clearly.
- In epmodel tests, prefer public wrapper APIs and typed `Model` queries.
  Avoid low-level `Workspace`/`IdfObject` helpers unless the test is
  explicitly about that layer.
- In epmodel tests, construct the concrete wrapper under test rather than
  using `ModelObject::create(...)` as a shortcut.

## Canonicalization Policy

- Canonicalization is the central repair and assurance phase. It should run at
  model construction and load boundaries, not as an ad hoc runtime crutch.
- Canonicalizers must converge the model to a valid epmodel state.
- Prefer repair over rejection when the intended structure can be recovered
  reasonably from persisted EnergyPlus-backed storage.
- If content is not salvageable without inventing unsupported semantics, drop
  the minimum invalid content necessary to restore validity.
- Do not leave partially repaired or internally contradictory topology behind.
- Outside canonicalizers, normal API methods should not invoke
  canonicalization. They should assume canonical state and rely on established
  invariants.
- When cross-type ordering is not guaranteed, refactor canonicalization scope
  upward so ordering is guaranteed there instead of adding runtime fallback
  paths.
- After canonicalization, prefer assertions and direct logic over fallback
  branches for guaranteed states.
- Canonicalizers must log meaningful repairs, drops, normalizations, and
  failed repair attempts through `addLoadInfo`, `addLoadWarning`, and
  `addLoadError`.
- Keep canonicalization logic close to the owning type so repair decisions
  remain local, explicit, and reviewable.
- For compound HVAC owners, implement separate impl-level methods for normal
  owner maintenance and canonicalization repair, such as
  `maintainContainedAirPath()` and `repairContainedAirPath(LoadContext&)`, or
  `maintainContainedTopology()` and `repairContainedTopology(LoadContext&)`
  when the owned structure is broader than air alone. Do not collapse those
  two call paths back into one public-facing routine.
- Keep contained-child routing rules owner-local. If a compound family needs
  to switch on supported child types to find air inlet or outlet ports, do it
  in that family's `.cpp` with a plain comment that says what is allowed.
  Do not keep growing shared base helpers that try to enumerate every child
  shape used by every compound HVAC family.
- Do not hand-roll node-field resolution in local files. If code needs the
  `Node` behind a node field, use the shared `ModelObject_Impl`
  node-field helpers so resolved nodes are linked back to the owning field and
  later renames stay tracked.
- When canonical `openstudio::model` exposes OS-only companion objects that do
  not exist as standalone EnergyPlus objects, epmodel may model them additively
  as transient child wrappers backed by persisted parent storage. Keep that
  write-through mapping explicit, document it in the type notes, and avoid
  inventing fake persisted children.

## Schema Alignment Notes Convention

Type-local parity status belongs in `Schema Alignment Notes` blocks in
`src/epmodel/**/*.hpp`.

Required bullets:

- `Status`
- `Canonical Counterpart`
- `Implemented Parity`

Optional bullets when useful:

- `Documented Delta`
- `Field/Storage Mapping`
- `Evidence`

`Remaining Parity Work` is required unless the type is truly at parity with
only documented deltas remaining.

Status vocabulary:

- `Scaffolded`
- `Scalar Parity`
- `Partial Parity`
- `Near Parity`
- `Parity with documented deltas`

## Review Guidlines

For any non trivial code changes use dedicated sub agents to review for *at minimum* the following items.

- Adherence to the agent notes in this file
- Adherence to the epmodel/README.md
- Any required updates to epmodel/README.md to maintain consistency between code and README.
- Consistency with prior art in similar data types and bodies of code.
